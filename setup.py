Main installation and project management script for this project.

Requires setuptools, and even attempts to install it automatically if it is
not available, downloading it from PyPI if needed. Having setuptools available
provides us with the following benefits:
  - py2to3/distutils integration
  - setup.py 'egg_info' command constructing the project's metadata
  - setup.py 'develop' command deploying the project in 'development mode',
    thus making it available on sys.path, yet still editable directly in its
    source checkout - equivalent to running a pip based installation using
    'easy_install -e' or 'pip install -e'
  - setup.py 'test' command as a standard way to run the project's test suite
  - when running the installation directly from the source tree setup.py
    'install' command:
      - automatically installs the project's metadata so package management
        tools like pip recognize the installation correctly, e.g. this allows
        using 'pip uninstall' to undo the installation
      - package installed as a zipped egg by default

    If a compatible setuptools version is detected, automatically imports its
