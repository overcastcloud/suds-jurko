class CompareSAX:
    """
    Support for comparing SAX XML structures.

    Not intended to be perfect, but only good enough XML comparison to be used
    internally inside the project's test suite.

    Raw XML data is parsed using a suds SAX parser and the resulting DOM
    structure compared. This means that any XML data differences lost during
    SAX parsing can not be detected. Some examples:
      - all textual content for a single node is concatenated together, so the
        following two XML data segments are considered equivalent:
          1. '<a>xx<b/>yy</a>'
          2. '<a>xxyy<b/></a>'
      - all leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed from textual content for
        nodes having at least one child element, so most XML indentation
        information is lost and the following two XML data segments are
        considered equivalent:
          1. '<a>   <b/>     </a>'
          2. '<a><b/></a>'

    Suds may generate different SOAP request XML data for the same input based
    on the order in which it reads some of its internal data held inside
    unordered containers, e.g. set or dictionary. To compensate for this we
    consider both namespace prefix & namespace declaration (either extra
    declarations or declaration placement) differences in XML documents as
    irrelevant. We do however compare each XML node's namespace, i.e. that
    their namespace names match even if their namespace prefixes do not or if
    those namespaces have been declared on different XML elements.

    Empty string & None XML element texts are considered the same to compensate
    for different XML object tree construction methods representing 'no text'
    elements differently, e.g. depending on whether a particular SAX parsed XML
    element had any whitespace characters in its textual data or whether the
    element got constructed in code to represent a SOAP request.
